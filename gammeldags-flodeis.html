				For my 1. semester examens project I was tasked with creating a 
				campaign site for the danish ice cream brand Gammeldags Flødeis. 
				This project was an individual project, so I have been through every 
				process on my own.

				<h2>The street interview challenge</h2>
				<p>
					The thing I probably remember the best from this project, was how 
					I challenged myself to stop random people on the street and ask if 
					they wouldn’t mind answering a few questions about their ice cream 
					habits if they had one. Considering I have struggled to talk to people 
					in the past, this was quite a challenge, that also proved a little 
					too hard, but I did manage to get some useful answers, and a recipe for 
					homemade ice cream which was pretty cool, haven’t tried it yet though.
				</p>
				<p>
					Normally asking random people on the street is not the best way to do 
					user research, especially when you’re in the middle of a pandemic, in 
					this case though, I was trying to find a direction to take my campaign, 
					and since everyone knows what ice cream is, most people should have 
					opinions and feelings about ice cream. And honestly, I really wanted 
					to challenge myself to talk to random people on the street, after all, 
					the best way to learn is by doing.

				<h2>Researching the brand’s identity</h2>
				<p>
					Before I went out to the street, I had done some research on the brand and 
					its history, as well as the danish people’s ice cream habits. So, I already 
					had an idea of were I wanted to take my campaign, which made the field work 
					as much a search for confirmation as it was a search for a direction to my 
					campaign.
				</p>
				<p>
					With a brand name Gammeldags flødeis which translate to Old-fashioned 
					Ice Cream, with the brand owner’s, the danish company Premier Is, history 
					going all the way back to one of the first danish companies to produce 
					ice cream, and the packaging design saying old traditions, a nostalgic 
					direction for the campaign seems obvious. The research also showed that 
					people care about the ingredients used in the ice cream, so I would not 
					want to leave that out of the campaign either.

				<h2>The website should be accessible for everyone</h2>
				<p>
					From the research I based the persona on the older segment, since ice cream 
					is for everyone I wanted the campaign to be for everyone as well, and if I 
					can make it accessible for the old segment, it should be accessible for everyone.
				</p>
				<p>
					The main thing I did to make it accessible for the older segment, was to 
					avoid having too many confusing things on the screen at the same time, to 
					make it easy for the user to know what they are supposed to focus on, so 
					I used a lot of whitespace with only one or few things on the screen at 
					same time, and relied on simple pictures or text to say what I wanted to say.

				<h2>Hand drawing for the nostalgic feeling</h2>
				<p>
					To hit the nostalgic feeling, I choose to hand draw an ice cream box in 
					a 50’s – 60’s advertisement style. The ice cream box is open and old 
					pictures of people eating ice cream together pops out, because ice cream 
					is mostly enjoyed together. This picture is to support the slogan 
					“Nostalgi i en boks” which translate to “Nostalgia in a box”, in a simple 
					easy to understand way.<br>
					I also do like to practise my drawing skills from time to time, let me 
					know how you think the drawing looks, that way I also know you’ve read 
					all this ;).<br>
					I wanted to hand draw the lids from the different ice cream variants in 
					the same style, with the difference being the ingredient being coloured 
					to stand out, to support the text telling what variant it is, but I ran 
					out of time.

				<h2>Making consistent accessibility for everyone</h2>
				<p>
					On the pages where I showcase each variant on their own, I edited a picture 
					of some free roaming cows to make it look like an old photo to make the 
					style consistent. This picture is also there to support the short 
					description of the product, saying the ice cream is made of the best 
					ingredients, to continue making the user experience accessible for everyone, 
					by using little text supported by a simple picture, without too much going 
					on at the same time.
