# My Portfolio

## Description
This is the code for my portfolio. I’m sharing it publicly because it demonstrates my understanding of fundamental front-end technologies, and also gives insight into my design and development process.

It has gone through a lot of changes from my initial concept, as I’ve worked to refine it by following modern design principles. My goal has been to create a clean, intuitive, and fully responsive design across various screen sizes, from mobile devices to wide desktop displays.
