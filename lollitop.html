				To the 2. semester examens project we worked with a newly started upcycling 
				cloth brand called Lollitop, who is so far only selling their cloth through 
				their Instagram profile Lollitop8000. That is also exactly why we decided 
				to work with them, we wanted to create an informative site about the brand 
				that also featured a web shop to make buying their cloth easier for the 
				costumer.

				<h2>An interesting project</h2>
				<p>
					This project was an interesting one to do, because Lollitop had this 
					weird style called Y2K we had to work with, which do not like 
					conventions.<br>
					I mean, seriously, watch their launch video on Instagram Lollitop8000 
					you’ll understand.<br>
					It made it difficult to make a user friendly web shop that didn’t look 
					like a scam.
				</p>
				<p>
					From the brand owner there was a wish that the site and brand should 
					be as much as an art piece as cloth you would wear in special occasions. 
					So, we wanted to make the site and experience that both show the user 
					the brands style and identity and gives the user a place to buy the 
					product that is not Instagram. To do so the first thing you see on 
					the website is a giant logo that rotates and play a song made for 
					the brand when hovering over it. We also programmed a parallax effect 
					for some bubbles inspired by a parallax solution fund on the internet. 
					This way the user gets a taste of the brands identity immediately.

				<h2>A challenging style</h2>
				<p>
					One of the problems working with the Y2K style was how easily the 
					website got confusing to look at, because of the many colours and 
					elements. The way we tried to fix that was by changing the name of 
					the products colour to a neutral grey white colour and got rid of 
					the background colour for the navigation bar buttons. If we had to 
					work further with this project, we would probably try to find a less 
					attention-grabbing background, which also makes it faster to load 
					the website on your phone.

				<h2>Want to show what makes the brand unique</h2>
				<p>
					Other than their style and identity, another thing that makes 
					Lollitop unique is that there only exist one version of each cloth 
					piece they sell, so every time a piece of cloth is displayed so is 
					the cloths unique number and name, because that is a way Lollitop 
					could stand out from their competitors, if the weird style isn’t enough.
				</p>
				<p>
					To make sure people know Lollitop are selling cloth, we wanted to 
					make it easy and quick to get a preview of the cloth they are selling, 
					so that is the next thing you see on the front page. To make it 
					convenient, you can click on the previewed cloth to go directly to 
					the product’s page.

				<h2>My main contribution</h2>
				<p>
					The part of the project I worked on the most is the shop page and 
					the pages for each product, where you can buy and learn more about 
					the cloth you are interested in. The overall design for those pages 
					was a shared effort by the whole group. <br>
					However, the TV-frame was my idea and I wanna take credit for that, 
					‘cause I made 12 different versions of that frame, so it wouldn’t 
					fill too much in the design and take the focus away from the products. 
					It was pretty fun to do though, and I learned some new tools in Photoshop.<br>
					Anyway, to make browsing through the products simple and easy on 
					the shop page, we only show the product, its unique name and number 
					and the price. For easier and intuitive browsing I made a simple 
					category system, so the user can easily find those products they 
					are interested in.
				</p>
				<p>
					On the pages for each individual product, there was a wish from 
					the user to be able to see the cloth from different angles. 
					To make that easy and intuitive, I made 3 clickable buttons with 
					the names Front, Side and Back, when clicked they show the product 
					from the angle they are named with.
